# news_api
airtribe second core project

The register and login endpoints are working and news endpoint are working however, i haven't provided input validations and other details given in the project requirement.
The project is incomplete as of now since I have messed up the works while trying to do a re work on codes when trying to modify project structure.
I have used Mongoose to connect to MongoDB and I am stroing users there.
You may test the endpoints and pls go through and help me improve with your feedbacks.
Thanks!
